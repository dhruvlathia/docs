Welcome to the documentation for the Anime Character Catcher Bot. This guide provides a high-level overview of the game's design and technical foundation.

## Core Concept

The bot is a Telegram-based RPG where users collect anime character cards, battle each other, manage an economy, and use a variety of items to gain advantages. The core loop involves:

1.  **Collecting:** Characters automatically drop in chats.
2.  **Battling:** Users fight each other using their stats and items.
3.  **Growing:** Players level up, upgrade artifacts, and build their net worth.
4.  **Interacting:** Players can trade, bet, and even steal from each other.

## Technical Stack

-   **Language:** Node.js (using `telegraf.js`) or Python (using `aiogram`).
-   **Database:** **Firebase Realtime Database** for all persistent data, including user profiles, inventories, and game state.
-   **Hosting:** A virtual private server (VPS) or a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Google Cloud).
