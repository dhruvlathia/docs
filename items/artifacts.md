# Item List: Artifacts

Artifacts are permanent, upgradable items that offer powerful passive bonuses. They are a player's primary long-term investment. Each artifact can be upgraded to a **maximum of Level 10**, with its effect scaling predictably with each level. The number of artifacts you can equip is `floor(Player Level / 2)`.

The effect scaling follows this rule: `Total Effect = (Effect at Level 1) * Artifact Level`.
